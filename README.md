# PHAs-classification
The problem of imbalanced datasets is common in machine learning, particularly in identifying rare events or outcomes. The lack of representative samples from minority classes can lead to biased models and inaccurate predictions. This project focuses on the classification of potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), a task that is particularly challenging due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset. We use the PHA dataset provided by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which contains information about the orbital and physical characteristics of PHAs. The proposed solution involves the use of oversampling techniques, specifically SMOTE and Borderline SMOTE, along with an artificial neural network (ANN) model for classification. These techniques help to balance the dataset and provide more representative samples for the minority class, leading to improved accuracy in identifying PHAs and reducing the risk of false negatives. Overall, the approach offers a solution for the classification of PHAs and can be applied to other imbalanced datasets in various domains.
